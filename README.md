# Xcelore-Project
A platform where doctors can register their patients through a mobile or web portal.
To achieve this project, we need to create a Spring Boot application using Java, which involves setting up entities for doctors and patients, creating repositories, services, and controllers for handling API requests, and implementing the logic for suggesting doctors based on patient symptoms and location.
